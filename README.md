Hospital Patient Database – Python CLI App

This is a beginner-level command-line application for managing hospital patient records. Built using core Python features like dictionaries, loops, and conditionals, it allows users to add, view, and delete patient entries, each assigned a unique auto-incrementing ID.

Features

Add new patient records (name, age, gender, diagnosis)
View patient information by ID
Delete patient records by ID
Auto-generated patient IDs to ensure uniqueness
Clean, menu-driven terminal interface

What I Learned

Core Python syntax and control structures
Dictionary-based data storage
Designing user-friendly CLI menus
Breaking logic into reusable functions

Why This Project

This is the first project in my software portfolio, aimed at building a solid foundation in programming logic. It showcases my ability to structure, test, and iterate on real-world functionality — and sets the stage for more advanced projects involving file storage, APIs, and full-stack development.
